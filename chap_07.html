        </h3>
        <div class="hline">&nbsp;</div>
        <p>
                Let's write a program which asks us to type in as many words
      as we want (one word per line, continuing until we just press
      <kbd>Enter</kbd> on an empty line), and which then repeats
      the words back to us in alphabetical order.  OK?

        </p>
        <p>
                So... first we'll&mdash;uh... um... hmmm...  Well, we could&mdash;er...
      um...

        </p>
        <p>
                You know, I don't think we can do it.  We need a way to store
      an unknown amount of words, and how to keep track of them all
      together, so they don't get mixed up with other variables.  We
      need to put them in some sort of a list.  We need <dfn>arrays</dfn>.

        </p>
        <p>
                An array is just a list in your computer.  Every slot in
      the list acts like a variable:  you can see what object
      a particular slot points to, and you can make it point to a
      different object.  Let's take a look at some arrays:

        </p>
        <pre class="L2PcodeBlock">[]
[<span class="L2Pnumber">5</span>]
['<span class="L2Pstring">Hello</span>', '<span class="L2Pstring">Goodbye</span>']

flavor = '<span class="L2Pstring">vanilla</span>'             <span class="L2Pcomment"># This is not an array, of course...</span>
[<span class="L2Pnumber">89.9</span>, flavor, [<span class="L2Pkeyword">true</span>, <span class="L2Pkeyword">false</span>]]  <span class="L2Pcomment"># ...but this is.</span></pre>
        <p>
                So first we have an empty array, then an array holding
      a single number, then an array holding two strings.
      Next, we have a simple assignment; then an
      array holding three objects, the last
      of which is the array <span class="L2Pcode">[<span class="L2Pkeyword">true</span>,&nbsp;<span class="L2Pkeyword">false</span>]</span>.  Remember,
      variables aren't objects, so our last array is really
      pointing to float, a <em>string</em>, and an array.  Even if we
      were to set <span class="L2Pcode">flavor</span> to
      point to something else, that wouldn't change the
      array.

        </p>
        <p>
                To help us find a particular object in an array, each
      slot is given an index number.  Programmers (and, incidentally,
      most mathematicians) start counting from zero, though,
      so the first slot in the array is slot zero.  Here's
      how we would reference the objects in an array:

        </p>
        <pre class="L2PcodeBlock">names = ['<span class="L2Pstring">Ada</span>', '<span class="L2Pstring">Belle</span>', '<span class="L2Pstring">Chris</span>']

puts names
puts names[<span class="L2Pnumber">0</span>]
puts names[<span class="L2Pnumber">1</span>]
puts names[<span class="L2Pnumber">2</span>]
puts names[<span class="L2Pnumber">3</span>]  <span class="L2Pcomment"># This is out of range.</span></pre>
        <pre class="L2PoutputBlock">
Ada
Belle
Chris
Ada
Belle
Chris

</pre>
        <p>
                So, we see that <span class="L2Pcode">puts&nbsp;names</span> prints each name in
      the array <span class="L2Pcode">names</span>.  Then we use <span class="L2Pcode">puts&nbsp;names[<span class="L2Pnumber">0</span>]</span>
      to print out the "first" name in the array, and
      <span class="L2Pcode">puts&nbsp;names[<span class="L2Pnumber">1</span>]</span> to print the "second"... I'm sure this seems
      confusing, but you <em>do</em> get used to it.  You just have to really
      start <em>thinking</em> that counting begins at zero, and
      stop using words like "first" and "second".
      If you go out to a five-course meal, don't talk about
      the "first" course; talk about course zero
      (and in your head, be thinking <span class="L2Pcode">course[<span class="L2Pnumber">0</span>]</span>).
      You have five fingers on your right hand, and their
      numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.  My wife and I are
      jugglers.  When we juggle six clubs, we are juggling
      clubs 0-5.  Hopefully in the next few months, we'll
      be able to juggle club 6 (and thus be juggling seven
      clubs between us).  You'll know you've got it when you
      start using the word "zeroth".  :-) Yes, it's a real
      word; ask any programmer or mathematician.

        </p>
        <p>
                Finally, we tried <span class="L2Pcode">puts&nbsp;names[<span class="L2Pnumber">3</span>]</span>, just to see what
      would happen.  Were you expecting an error?  Sometimes when
      you ask a question, your question doesn't make sense (at
      least to your computer); that's when you get an error.
      Sometimes, however, you can ask a question and the answer
      is <em>nothing</em>.  What's in slot three?  Nothing.
      What is <span class="L2Pcode">names[<span class="L2Pnumber">3</span>]</span>?  <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">nil</span></span>:  Ruby's way
      of saying "nothing".  <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">nil</span></span> is a special object
      which basically means "not any other object." And when you
      <span class="L2Pcode">puts&nbsp;<span class="L2Pkeyword">nil</span></span>, it prints out nothing. (Just a new line.)

        </p>
        <p>
                If all this funny numbering of array slots is getting to
      you, fear not!  Often, we can avoid them completely by
      using various array methods, like this one:

        </p>
        <h2>
          The Method <span class="L2Pcode">each</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
                <span class="L2Pcode">each</span> allows us to do something (whatever we
      want) to <span class="L2Pcode">each</span> object the array points to.  So, if we
      want to say something nice about each language in the array
      below, we'd do this:

        </p>
        <pre class="L2PcodeBlock">languages = ['<span class="L2Pstring">English</span>', '<span class="L2Pstring">German</span>', '<span class="L2Pstring">Ruby</span>']

languages.each <span class="L2Pkeyword">do</span> |lang|
  puts '<span class="L2Pstring">I love </span>' + lang + '<span class="L2Pstring">!</span>'
  puts '<span class="L2Pstring">Don\'t you?</span>'
<span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span>

puts '<span class="L2Pstring">And let\'s hear it for C++!</span>'
puts '<span class="L2Pstring">...</span>'</pre>
        <pre class="L2PoutputBlock">
I love English!
Don't you?
I love German!
Don't you?
I love Ruby!
Don't you?
And let's hear it for C++!
...
</pre>
        <p>
                So what just happened?  Well, we were able to go through
      every object in the array without using any numbers, so
      that's definitely nice.  Translating into English, the above
      program reads something like:  For <span class="L2Pcode">each</span> object
      in <span class="L2Pcode">languages</span>, point the variable <span class="L2Pcode">lang</span>
      to the object and then <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">do</span></span> everything I tell you to,
      until you come to the <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span></span>.  (Just so you know,
      C++ is another programming language.  It's much harder to
      learn than Ruby; usually, a C++ program will be many times
      longer than a Ruby program which does the same thing.)

        </p>
        <p>
                You might be thinking to yourself, "This is a lot like
      the loops we learned about earlier."  Yep, it's similar.
      One important difference is that the method <span class="L2Pcode">each</span>
      is just that:  a method.  <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">while</span></span> and <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span></span>
      (much like <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">do</span></span>, <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">if</span></span>, <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">else</span></span>, and all the other
      <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">blue</span></span>
      words) are not methods.  They are a fundamental part of the Ruby
      language, just like <span class="L2Pcode">=</span> and parentheses; kind of
      like punctuation marks in English.

        </p>
        <p>
                But not <span class="L2Pcode">each</span>; <span class="L2Pcode">each</span> is just another
      array method.  Methods like <span class="L2Pcode">each</span> which "act like"
      loops are often called <dfn>iterators</dfn>.

        </p>
        <p>
                One thing to notice about iterators is that they are
      always followed by <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">do</span></span>...<span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span></span>.
      <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">while</span></span> and <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">if</span></span> never had a <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">do</span></span>
      near them; we only use <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">do</span></span> with iterators.

        </p>
        <p>
                Here's another cute little iterator, but it's not an
      array method... it's an integer method!

        </p>
        <pre class="L2PcodeBlock"><span class="L2Pnumber">3</span>.times <span class="L2Pkeyword">do</span>
  puts '<span class="L2Pstring">Hip-Hip-Hooray!</span>'
<span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span></pre>
        <pre class="L2PoutputBlock">
Hip-Hip-Hooray!
Hip-Hip-Hooray!
Hip-Hip-Hooray!
</pre>
        <h2>
          More Array Methods
        </h2>
        <p>
                So we've learned <span class="L2Pcode">each</span>,
      but there are many other array methods... almost as
      many as there are string methods!  In fact, some of
      them (like <span class="L2Pcode">length</span>, <span class="L2Pcode">reverse</span>,
      <span class="L2Pcode">+</span>, and <span class="L2Pcode">*</span>)
      work just like they do for strings, except that they
      operate on the slots of the array rather than the
      letters of the string.  Others, like <span class="L2Pcode">last</span>
      and <span class="L2Pcode">join</span>, are specific to arrays.  Still
      others, like <span class="L2Pcode">push</span> and <span class="L2Pcode">pop</span>,
      actually change the array.  And just as with
      the string methods, you don't have to remember
      all of these, as long as you can remember where to
      find out about them (right here).

        </p>
        <p>
                First, let's look at <span class="L2Pcode">to_s</span> and <span class="L2Pcode">join</span>.
      <span class="L2Pcode">join</span> works much like <span class="L2Pcode">to_s</span> does, except
      that it adds a string in between the array's objects.
      Let's take a look:

        </p>
        <pre class="L2PcodeBlock">foods = ['<span class="L2Pstring">artichoke</span>', '<span class="L2Pstring">brioche</span>', '<span class="L2Pstring">caramel</span>']

puts foods
puts
puts foods.to_s
puts
puts foods.join('<span class="L2Pstring">, </span>')
puts
puts foods.join('<span class="L2Pstring">  :)  </span>') + '<span class="L2Pstring">  8)</span>'

<span class="L2Pnumber">200</span>.times <span class="L2Pkeyword">do</span>
  puts []
<span class="L2Pkeyword">end</span></pre>
        <pre class="L2PoutputBlock">
artichoke
brioche
caramel

[&quot;artichoke&quot;, &quot;brioche&quot;, &quot;caramel&quot;]

artichoke, brioche, caramel

artichoke  :)  brioche  :)  caramel  8)
</pre>
        <p>
                As you can see, <span class="L2Pcode">puts</span> treats arrays differently
      from other objects:  it just calls <span class="L2Pcode">puts</span> on each
      of the objects in the array.  That's why <span class="L2Pcode">puts</span>ing
      an empty array 200 times doesn't do anything; the array doesn't
      point to anything, so there's nothing to <span class="L2Pcode">puts</span>.  (Doing
      nothing 200 times is still doing nothing.)
      Try <span class="L2Pcode">puts</span>ing an array containing other arrays;
      does it do what you expected?

        </p>
        <p>
                Also, did you notice that I left out the empty strings when
      I wanted to <span class="L2Pcode">puts</span> a blank line?  It does the same
      thing.

        </p>
        <p>
                Now let's take a look at <span class="L2Pcode">push</span>, <span class="L2Pcode">pop</span>,
      and <span class="L2Pcode">last</span>.  The methods <span class="L2Pcode">push</span> and <span class="L2Pcode">pop</span>
      are sort of opposites,
      like <span class="L2Pcode">+</span> and <span class="L2Pcode">-</span> are.  <span class="L2Pcode">push</span> adds
      an object to the end of your array, and <span class="L2Pcode">pop</span>
      removes the last object from the array (and tell you
      what it was).  <span class="L2Pcode">last</span> is similar to <span class="L2Pcode">pop</span>
      in that it tells you what's at the end of the array,
      except that it leaves the array alone.
      Again, <span class="L2Pcode">push</span> and <span class="L2Pcode">pop</span> <em>actually
      change the array</em>:

        </p>
        <pre class="L2PcodeBlock">favorites = []
favorites.push '<span class="L2Pstring">raindrops on roses</span>'
favorites.push '<span class="L2Pstring">whiskey on kittens</span>'

puts favorites[<span class="L2Pnumber">0</span>]
puts favorites.last
puts favorites.length

puts favorites.pop
puts favorites
puts favorites.length</pre>
        <pre class="L2PoutputBlock">

          A Few Things to Try
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Write the program we talked about at the very beginning
           of this chapter.<br />
           <em><strong>Hint:</strong>  There's a lovely
           array method which will give you a sorted version of an
           array:  </em><span class="L2Pcode">sort</span><em>.  Use it!</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            Try writing the above program <em>without</em> using
           the <span class="L2Pcode">sort</span> method.  A large part of programming is
           solving problems, so get all the practice you can!
          </li>
          <li>
            Rewrite your Table of Contents program (from the chapter
           on <a href="/LearnToProgram/chap_05.html">methods</a>).  Start the program
           with an array holding all of the information for your Table
           of Contents (chapter names, page numbers, etc.).  Then print
           out the information from the array in a beautifully formatted
           Table of Contents.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
                So far we have learned quite a number of different methods.
      Now it's time to learn how to
      <a href="/LearnToProgram/chap_08.html">make our own</a>.
