        <h2>
          A Place to Start for the Future&nbsp;Programmer
        </h2>
        <p>
                I guess this all began back in 2002.  I was thinking
      about teaching programming, and what a great language
      Ruby would be for learning how to program.  I mean, we were
      all excited about Ruby because it was powerful, elegant, and
      really just fun, but it seemed to me that it would also
      be a great way to get into programming in the first place.

        </p>
        <p>
                Unfortunately, there wasn't much Ruby documentation
      geared for newbies at the time.  Some of us
      in the community were talking about what such a
      "Ruby for the Nuby" tutorial would
      need, and more generally, how to teach programming at all.
      The more I thought about this, the more I had to say (which
      surprised me a bit).  Finally, someone said, "Chris,
      why don't you just write a tutorial instead of talking about
      it?"  So I did.

        </p>
        <p>
                And it wasn't very good.  I had all these ideas that were good
      <em>in theory</em>, but the actual task of making a great
      tutorial for non-programmers was vastly more challenging than
      I had realized.  (I mean, it seemed good to me, but I already
      knew how to program.)

        </p>
        <p>
                What saved me was that I made it really easy for people to
      contact me, and I always tried to help people when they got
      stuck.  When I saw a lot of people getting stuck in one place,
      I'd rewrite it.  It was a lot of work, but it slowly got better
      and better.

        </p>
        <p>
                A couple of years later, it was getting pretty good.  :-)  So
      good, in fact, that I was ready to pronounce it finished, and
      move on to something else.  And right about then came an
      opportunity to turn the tutorial into a book.  Since it was
      already basically done, I figured this would be no problem.
      I'd just clean up a few spots, add some more exercises, maybe
      some more examples, a few more chapters, run it by 50 more
      reviewers...

        </p>
        <p>
                It took me another year, but now I think it's really
      <em>really</em> good, mostly because of the hundreds of
      brave souls who have helped me write it.

        </p>
        <p>
                What's here on this site is the original tutorial, more or less
      unchanged since 2004.  For the latest and greatest, you'll
      want to check out <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ltp2/learn-to-program-2nd-edition">the book</a>.

        <h2>
          Thoughts For Teachers
        </h2>
        <p>
                There were a few guiding principles that I tried to stick to.
      I think they make the learning process much smoother;
      learning to program is hard enough as it is.  If you're
      teaching or guiding someone on the road to hackerdom, these
      ideas might help you, too.

        </p>
        <p>
                First, I tried to separate concepts as much as possible,
      so that the student would only have to learn
      one concept at a time.  This was difficult at first, but a little
      <em>too</em> easy after I had some practice.  Some things must be
      taught before others, but I was amazed at how little of
      a precedence hierarchy there really is.  Eventually, I just had to
      pick an order, and I tried to arrange things so that each
      new section was motivated by the previous ones.

        </p>
        <p>
                Another principle I've kept in mind is to teach only one way
      to do something.  It's an obvious benefit in a tutorial for
      people who have never programmed before.  For one thing,
      one way to do something is easier to learn than two.  Perhaps
      the more important benefit, though, is that the fewer things
      you teach a new programmer, the more creative and clever
      they have to be in their programming.  Since so much of programming
      is problem solving, it's crucial to encourage that as much
      as possible at every stage.

        </p>
        <p>
                I have tried to piggy-back programming concepts onto concepts
      the new programmer already has; to present ideas in such a way
      that their intuition will carry the load, rather than the
      tutorial.  Object-Oriented programming lends itself to this
      quite well.  I was able to begin referring to "objects" and
      different "kinds of objects" pretty early in the tutorial,
      slipping those phrases in at the most innocent of moments.
      I wasn't saying anything like "everything in Ruby is an
      object," or "numbers and strings are kinds of objects,"
      because these statements really don't mean anything to
      a new programmer.  Instead, I would talk about strings
      (not "string objects"), and sometimes I would refer to
      "objects", simply meaning "the things in these programs."
      The fact that all these <em>things</em> in Ruby <em>are</em> objects
      made this sort of sneakiness on my part work so well.

        </p>
        <p>
                Although I wanted to avoid needless OO jargon, I wanted
      to make sure that, if they did need to learn a word, they
      learned the right one.  (I don't want them to have to learn
      it twice, right?)  So I called them "strings," not "text."  Methods
      needed to be called something, so I called them "methods."

        </p>
        <p>
                As far as the exercises are concerned, I think I came up
      with some good ones, but you can never have too many.
      Honestly, I bet I spent half of my time just trying to
      come up with fun, interesting exercises.
      Boring exercises absolutely kill any desire
      to program, while the perfect exercise creates an itch
      the new programmer can't help but scratch.  In short,
      you just can't spend too much time coming up with good
      exercises.

          About the Original Tutorial
        </h2>
        <p>
                The pages of the tutorial (and even this page) are generated by a
      <a href="./?ShowTutorialCode=true">big Ruby program</a>,
      of course.  :-)
      All of the
      code samples were automatically run,
      and the output shown is the output they generated.
      I think this is the best, easiest, and
      certainly the coolest way to make sure that all of the
      code I present works <em>exactly</em> as I say it does.
      You don't have to worry that I might have copied the output
      of one of the examples
      wrong, or forgotten to test some of the code; it's all been tested.

        <p>
                Finally, I'd like to thank everyone on the ruby-talk mailing list
      for their thoughts and encouragement, all of my wonderful
      reviewers for their help in making the book far better than
      I could have alone, my dear wife especially
      for being my main reviewer/tester/guinea-pig/muse,
      Matz for creating this fabulous language, and the Pragmatic Programmers
      for telling me about it&mdash;and, of course, for publishing
      my book!
